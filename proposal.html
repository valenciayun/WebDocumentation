			<h2>Background</h2>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
      <h4 id="giving">Charitable Giving</h4>
      <p>The most popular cause for donating is for <strong>supporting children,</strong> taking up to 30% in 2019 (Good2Give, 2019). Young people are more likely to volunteer for charity services, whereas most average annual donations come from people over 65-years-old ("Spotlight on giving - who are Australia’s most charitable?", 2015).</p>
      <h4 id="target_audience">Understanding the Target Audience</h4>
      <p>
        To better understand the stakeholder’s values and concerns, research was conducted on reasons why Australians give. It has been identified that the top three reasons why Australians give are (Good2Give, 2019): 
        <ol>
          <li>Caring about the cause (54%)</li>
          <li>Helping people less fortunate than them (41%)</li>
          <li>Realising they can make a difference (33%)</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p>It has been found that the primary willingness to be <strong>involved</strong> in charities is driven by “the individual’s perception of the <em>importance of the cause</em>” and the <em>“feeling good”</em> factor of creating positive change. Similarly, the perception of importance, trust, and reputation are the main reasons <strong>why</strong> people support charities (Kantar Public, 2017).</p>
      <h4 id="need">Understanding the Need</h4>
      <p>When research participants were asked to describe the key characteristics that define a trustworthy charity, the following traits were frequently mentioned (Kantar Public, 2017): 
        <ul>
          <li>familiarity</li>
          <li>organised (efficient)</li>
          <li>warm</li>
          <li>embracing (inclusive)</li>
          <li>works for a positive cause</li>
        </ul>
        Compared to the younger Australians, older Australians find it more crucial that a charity “makes a positive difference, has a good reputation, supports Australian causes and is well known.” They also stress the importance of charities making a positive difference, having a good reputation, and supporting Australian causes (Kantar Public, 2017).</p>
      <p>Those that are less involved are less likely to be satisfied with the information provided, and this is true mostly among the younger generation of Australians. Albeit, they are the most “content-thirsty” age group and are most likely to seek information before making a donation (Kantar Public, 2017). 64% of Australians aged 18-24 are more likely to find out about the charity before making a donation. Thus, <strong>providing relevant and useful information that is easily accessible</strong> is crucial to encourage donations. Moreover, 76% of Australians feel the importance to have a clear understanding of <strong>how charities use donations and know the proportion (Kantar Public, 2017).</strong> To do this, charities should monitor and report all expenditure for governance and transparency.</p>
      <h4 id="interview">Interview Insights</h4>
      <p>According to the interviews, people found providing education as one of the two most important services to provide for children's services. One of the common reasons why interviewees do not financially support charities is because they believe there are other ways to help people who are in need. This data suggests that adequate information on ways to get involved with charities should be clearly provided.</p>
      <h4 id="about_variety">Variety - The Children's Charity</h4>
      <p>
        For my website proposal, I have looked into <em>Variety - The Children's Charity.</em> <em>Variety</em> helps children years 0-17 who are disadvantaged, have a sickness, or need special help (Variety- the Children’s Charity, 2020). They help these children reach their full potential and realise their dreams. They work to allow children to gain mobility and freedom, to become contributing members in the community, to achieve independence, increase self-esteem. The four main ways Variety helps children in need are:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grants:</strong> grant equipment, educational resources, and technology</li>
          <li><strong>Scholarships:</strong> encourage the talents of kids in need</li>
          <li><strong>Programs:</strong> educate and empower kids in need through an intensive education program to overcome language and learning problems and keep up wit their classmates</li>
          <li><strong>Kids events:</strong> engage and bring joy to kids and families</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p><em>Variety - The Children's Charity</em> was founded in 1928. <em>Variety Australia</em> was founded in 1975 and was registered as a charity in Australian Charities and Not-for-profit Commission in 2012. It's a large charity, with a total income of more than $4,500,000. Most of their income comes from donations (73.94%) and their total expenses from donations take up the biggest portion of their total expenses ("Variety - the Children's Charity of Victoria", 2020).</p>
      <h4 id="key">Key Insights</h4>
      <p>
        Through the primary and secondary research, I have gathered key points and insights that will guide me on what I should focus on for the content of my website:
        <ul>
          <li>
            “Support is driven by the importance of the cause, trust, and reputation of the charity” (KANTAR)
            <ul>
              <li>The most influential driver of trust is worthiness.</li>
              <li>People want to see the positive contribution and influence charities make through their work.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Children services is one of the top causes people give to.
            <ul>
              <li>Importance of education is stressed, but people don’t have a clear reason why.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>When considering charities, people look for charities that aligns with their values and beliefs.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>In my website proposal, I will be focusing on Variety's "Intensive Program" they offer. My target audience will be people in the older generation since they are more likely to donate to Variety. The website will additionally focus on introducing other ways people could provide support for those who are not willing to help financially. Below, I have created four user profiles that "present key attributes of different identified users (Tomitsch, 2019)." </p>
			<h3 id="profiles">User Profiles</h3>
      <h4 id="profiles1">User Profiles 1</h4>

			<h2>Ideation</h2>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, the content of the website should show the importance of the cause, trust, and reputation of the charity. Once users gain trust, the charity should afford easy access to see what the users could do to contribute to the charity. For Variety, our goal would be to donate for the charity. In the following sections, I will go over how the website would be structured to highlight these key aspects.</p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
			<p>Mood boards were designed to collect visual inspirations and "visually represent design ideas, concepts, and values in an open-ended and evocative way (Tomitsch, 2019)." Both of the mood boards were designed according to the theme of Variety's original webiste, particularly their logo design.</p>
      <h4 id="moodboard1">Mood Board 1</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/moodboard1.png" alt="Moodboard Concept 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Moodboard Concept 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <!-- (Student, 2018) (Two Kids Writing on a Notebook, 2019) (little redhead kid studying, n.d.) (African cute kids studying at home, kids education concept, n.d.) (School kids studying with female teacher, n.d.) (Young Child, 2016) (day care worker with child, 2018) (Photo Of A Girl Writing, n.d.)  -->
      <p>The first mood board represents a toned-down colour palette. This is to create a feeling of sympathy and get more audience to become potential stakeholders. The design was inspired by another children's charity organisation, <a href="https://www.thesmithfamily.com.au" target="_blank">The Smith Family</a>. Their charity website uses a dark navy colour and photographs of sad children to capture their misery and unfortunate situations. Although this approach can move people's emotions, it does not quite match Variety's mission. First, children with disabilities, sicknesses, or in needs are not portrayed as kids who are in situations that are depressing. Secondly, Variety works to support in providing a brighter future for these kids instead of "saving" them from their struggles.</p>
      <h4 id="moodboard2">Mood Board 2</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/moodboard2.png" alt="Moodboard Concept 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Moodboard Concept 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <!-- (Happy child plays, n.d.) (happy child, 2018) (child in kindergarten, n.d.) (Preschool child, n.d.) -->
      <p>The second mood board takes up a brighter mood that matches well with the theme of Variety's current website. It shows images of young kids who are bright and hopeful. The colours create a playful and adventurous atmosphere. This goes well with how Variety seeks to provide support—by encouraging kids with special needs to have fun and explore their lives.</p>
			<h3 id="structure">Structure</h3>
			<p>The structure of the webstie was sketched out to construct a website that meets the users' needs and that affords easy navigation.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/structure1.png" alt="Structure 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Structure<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>First, the landing page had to consist all the necessary information that the user will need in order to validate the charity. The website will have three pages that inform about what the charity does (work and mission), its values, and actions that users can take to be involved and provide support. From my primary research, it was clear that people did not know how kids with lack of early childhood development compared to their peers will be impacted in their growth. Thus, "Our Work" page will briefly explain in detail why early education is important. For the "About Page", it would contain basic information about Variety and show credibility of the charity. Lastly, the "Get Involved" page would present what are ways people could help and support the charity, whether it be through donations or through service. Upon self-reflection, I realised that the website would lack in presenting the worthiness of Variety's charity work. This meant that statistics should back up and explain how our work is creating a good cause. In addition, I noticed how there is inadequate information to validate our charity. To resolve this issue, I decided to add another page for all the annual reports that Variety updates so that anyone can take a look at how they have done over the years.</p>
    <figure>
					<img src="images/structure2.png" alt="Structure 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Structure Refined<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>Taking my self-reflection into consideration, I drew another sketch of my website structure. I added more details to the educational program that Variety offers in "Our Work" page. I felt the need to create a separate page to put all the details of the program, so I decided to add another subpage under "Our Work". To gain more trust in Variety, I have added a history section in the "About Us" page. This creates a feeling of getting to know a charity on a "personal level". To show the worthiness of Variety's work, the "Get Involved" section will not only list the services people can join but also show how it has impacted the lives of many children in positive ways. The newly added "Reports" page will include documents of annual reports and a simple infographic on the proportio of the funds used for the cause.</p>
      <h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
      <figure>

      <figure>
					<img src="images/sitemapDetails.png" alt="Sitemap Details" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Details<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>Now that I have figured out the structure of my website, I started to work on the sketches of each page. Sketching was done using pen and paper, and it was annotated digitally on an iPad. Sketching was an important tool in my design process because "by putting ideas down on paper, they [became] clearer...[facilitated] a generative dialogue between [my] thoughts and [my] sketch (Tomitsch, 2019).</p>
      <h4 id="landingpage1">Landing Page 1</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/landingpage1.png" alt="Landing Page 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This first sketch of the landing page focuses on getting all the key information the users are searching on the landing page. Each of the contents on the landing page will be placed in a unifying object to allow quick skim through of what the charity believes, who the charity is, what they do, and how they are working for a good cause.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/m_landingpage1.png" alt="Landing Page 1 Mobile" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 1 Mobile<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>For the mobile version of this sketch, the navigation bar will be collapsed to fit the small screen. A few other adjustments will be made, such as the use of negative space and other graphic elements that are not necessary and does not hold meaning.</p>
      <h4 id="landingpage2">Landing Page 2</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/landingpage2.png" alt="Landing Page 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea aims to capture the users' emotion through a heartwarming message next to a photograph of a child in need. The missions will be in three different icons like bullet points to summarise the charity's missions in an engaging way.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/m_landingpage2.png" alt="Landing Page 2 Mobile" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 2 Mobile<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea might not work well with a mobile device because it involves a lot of negative space, which is challenging in a small mobile screen. Moreover, aligning the circular icons in a vertical alignment would break its unity and wouldn't look like one section of the page.</p>
      <h4 id="landingpage3">Landing Page 3</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/landingpage3.png" alt="Landing Page 3" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 3<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea replicates that of a news website by displaying all its content in a crammed format. Although this maximises the use of its space, it visually is unappealing to the user and may backfire as the user finds the website structure unorganised.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/m_landingpage3.png" alt="Landing Page 3 Mobile" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 3 Mobile<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>Converting this idea into a mobile screen would involve significant of changes due to the small screen.</p>
      <h4 id="landingpage4">Landing Page 4</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/landingpage4.png" alt="Landing Page 4" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 4<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This fourth idea presents the charity in a magazine or an opened book format. In contrast to the previous design, the layout is more engaging. The three boxes that descend diagonally was inspired by trendy Instastory formats such as templates from Unsplash.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/m_landingpage4.png" alt="Landing Page 4 Mobile" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 4 Mobile<center></figcaption>

      <p>To maximise the use of space in a mobile screen, the some of the text will have to go over images.</p>
      <h4 id="navbar">Navigation Bar</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/navbar.png" alt="navbar" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>navbar<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>To explore how the navigation bar would be located, I drew out simple sketches to see how well it would match the need of the user. I realised that there were numerous contents I missed. Consequently, some of the most well-known charity organisations' navigation bars were analysed to learn how their navigation bars achieve their goal—whether that be receiving donations or providing educational information about a certain topic.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/navBarAnalysis.png" alt="Navigation Bar Analysis" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Navigation Bar Analysis<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>Three websites were analysed: 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://www.charitywater.org" target="_blank">Charity Water</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.thesmithfamily.com.au" target="_blank">The Smith Family</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://www.wwf.org.au" target="_blank">The World Wide Fund for Nature</a></li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Charity Water 
            <ul>
              <li>
                Charity Water uses a drop down menu for its "Get Involved" button to allow a quick look at what they offer. Their main call-to-action button is surrounded with a box to show emphasis and prevent error by clicking on the wrong button.

          <li>
            The Smith Family 
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Smith Family has a simple design for their navigation bar, and they bring high contrast to their main call-to-action buttons using vibrant colours. 
              </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            World Wide Fund for Nature 
            <ul>
              <li>
                World Wide Fund for Nature uses the similar design idea for their two main call-to-action buttons. They use size and colour to catch the users' attention.
              </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>Key Insights: 
        <ul>
          <li>They all have two main call-to-action buttons.</li>
          <li>Avoid having too many buttons in the navigation bar. Instead of guiding where to find the information the user needs, it will confuse the user.</li>
          <li>Drop-down menus allow the user to quickly check if the website has the information they are looking for without having to click the button and wait for the page to load.</li>
        </ul>

      <p>Once I learned key insights through analysis, I created guidelines for myself to follow as I redesign the footer. The two designs I created better matches the goal of the website: to gain more donations and inform users of ways they could provide help and support for the charity.</p>
		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
        <p>Once the design ideas were finalised, they were converted to wireframes and then to mockups. Wireframes were created to "[draft] a structural and functional skeleton and mockups were made to envision products in a visual model. The mockups explore the visual aspects of the website, such as the style and colour (Tomitsch, 2019).</p>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      <h4 id="wf_landing">Landing Page</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_landing1.png" alt="Landing Page 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/mwf_landingpage1.png" alt="Mobile Landing Page 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Mobile Landing Page 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>The first idea is a simple and generic landing page layout. By following a common website layout, it makes it easier for the older generation to navigate through the website. It highlights the worthiness of the charity by presenting how the charity's work solves existing problems.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_landing2.png" alt="Landing Page 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Landing Page 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>The second idea uses an organic shape to match the current website's playful theme.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_work">Our Work</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_work1.png" alt="Our Work 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Our Work 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This design matches the theme of the first idea sketch for the landing page. It starts with a width-screen image for emphasis and goes into the main content.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_work2.png" alt="Our Work 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Our Work 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea creates a more concise layout by having the two sections side by side.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_about">About Us</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_about1.png" alt="About Us 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>About Us 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea is also designed in the theme of the first idea of the landing page. It is simple and straightforward to the point.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_about2.png" alt="About Us 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>About Us 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This design focuses on illustrating the history of the charity rather than the summary description of the charity. It emphasises the in-depth information of how the charity was founded.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_getinvolved">Get Involved</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_getinvolved1.png" alt="Get Involved 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Get Involved 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea presents the many different ways users can get involved with the charity. Having it in a tile saves space and helps the user easily look at all the services and events the charity provides.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_getinvolved2.png" alt="Get Involved 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Get Involved 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea highlights each of the ways users can be involved in a charity. Although it can showcase the services and events the charity holds in an impactful way, it is not the best interface design for the user.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_report">Report</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_report1.png" alt="Report 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Report 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea lists the annual reports in an orderly design layout with emphasis on the current year's impact backed up with statistics.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_report2.png" alt="Report 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Report 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea minimises space and shows the statistics of the charity's impact in an inforgraphic.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_program">Program</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_program1.png" alt="Program 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Program 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>Again, this theme follows a generic website design layout. The design is boring, but the familiarity of the website layout may be more important to the older generation than an aestehtic design layout that is confusing.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_program2.png" alt="Program 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Program 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This idea makes the three button more apparent than the previous design idea.</p>
      <h4 id="wf_donate">Donate</h4>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_donate1.png" alt="Donate 1" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Donate 1<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>This design was based on the current design layout of the charity's donate page but with adjustments. Instead of having the graphic element that indicates the amount of money in each column be placed inside the column, I redesigned it so that it is placed outside. This made it clearer that the money indicated is the <strong>choice</strong> of amount of money users can donate. Additionally, the empty fill for entering the amount of money was grayed out so that users know it's an alternative step.</p>
      <figure>
					<img src="images/wf_donate2.png" alt="Donate 2" width="100%">
					<figcaption><center>Donate 2<center></figcaption>
			  </figure>
      <p>Once I realised that the charity also has regular donations that users can subscribe to, I redesigned the donate page to include this. I created a button where users can choose between donating for one-time and subscribing to a regular donation.</p>
