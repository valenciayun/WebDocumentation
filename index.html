			<h2>Reflection on Proposal</h2>
      <p>This documentation discusses the changes that were made for the website Variety - Children's Charity. The documentation will go over the signficant changes were made in the content layout of the website and the detailed design decisions made throughout the process of creating the final web prototype.</p>
			<h3 id="research">Research</h3>
			<p>The high fidelity mock up initially included small sections of another page in each of the pages. For instance, the home page would include a glimpse of what the Get Involved page would talk about. Yet, this idea has been abandoned and any repeats were eliminated to avoid confusion. This way, the main information becomes clearer and guides the user to what content to focus on each page. </p>

      <p>The color of the logo and the main website was changed from red to yellow. This was inspired by Charity Water's website where their color of their main page well-aligned with their mission statement.  The energy that Charity Water radiates is a feeling of hope and a brighter future, which goes well with Variety - Children's Charity. As mentioned in the proposal, Variety's goal is to help Australian children with special needs to attain their full potential, regardless of ability or background. Their hope is to provide each children hopes and dreams for their future. Thus, the color of the logo and website was changed to yellow.</p>

      <p>Moreover, photographs used in the website had to generate a positive energy as well. All images were hand picked from Canva and from the Variety website itself. The aim was to develop empathy for children with disadvantages by communicating how everyone deserves an opportunity to dream a bright future. Additionally, further observation on pictures used in Variety made it clear that all the children who were and are being supported by Variety are Caucasians, so pictures of European descent children were used throughout all the webpages.</p>

      <h2>Iteration</h2>
      <p>To create a minimal and simple website design, grid-containers were created for each of the webpages. The purpose of the grid was to have the content for each page only take up the height of the scree so that there would be no more information that have to be seen through scrolling. By doing this, information and content had to be constrained into boxes, making it harder to place lengthy content and numerous images. However, in order to apply design principles and make the design look professional, there needed to be more negative space to balance out between content and white space. Information was too concise and was not providing enough to bring value to the target audience. Going back to the target user research in the web proposal, users need to have trust and assurance that the charity is working for a good cause with real impact. This was not attainable when information had to be significantly deducted. As a result, the idea of using a grid was abandoned and a new way of laying out content was adopted. With the help of a course from Udemy, Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3, a grid css was imported and used. Importing this grid made content flexible, yet still allow organized structure of information by having content side by side through pre-made columns and rows.</p>

      <p>The current Variety - Children' Charity looks slightly similar to Comic Sans; consequently, a font change was needed to make it look more professional yet keep its dynamic feeling. The font was changed from Century Gothic Pro to Bonkers. Century Gothic Pro looks more appropriate for formal documents and purposes, whereas Bonkers has more round characters for its typography. It looks cuter, which is fitting for a content that is about children. Once the font was bolded, it was highly noticeable that Bonkers was a display font created by an artist from Behance. As a result, there was lack of consistency and design principles for typography in the overall look of the logo when the font was bolded. Thus, a proper font that is registered in Google Fonts was selected. A clean sans-serif font Poppins was chosen because it had more round characters rather than narrow characters like Century Gothic Pro.</p>
      <p>Initially, the "Where Your Money Goes" and the "Our Program" sections had no background image. It was a darker solid gray color. When the web pages were loaded, they seemed to lack "life". There seemed to be a loss of connection and empathy to real life situations of children, so a background image of people were added to re-link the emotion to a community.</p>

      <p>After the final iteration, the text color of the logo was adjusted to match the background image of the header, which are mostly dark due to the black gradient.</p>
